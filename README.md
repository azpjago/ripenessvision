# 🍌 RipenessVision – Fruit Ripeness Detection using Computer Vision

RipenessVision is an **AI-powered image recognition system** that automatically detects the **ripeness level of fruits** (bananas, mangoes, and tomatoes) from images.  
This project demonstrates a **complete end-to-end pipeline** — from **data collection (via SerpAPI)** to **model training** and **deployment** using modern deep learning tools.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Many fruits are harvested or distributed without proper estimation of ripeness, leading to waste or quality issues.  
**RipenessVision** provides a simple yet intelligent way to **classify fruits into three ripeness stages**:

- 🟢 **Unripe**
- 🟡 **Ripe**
- ⚫ **Overripe**

The model is trained using images collected automatically from **Google Images** via **SerpAPI**, then processed and trained using **TensorFlow/Keras (EfficientNetB0)**.
